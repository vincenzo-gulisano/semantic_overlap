# semantic_overlap

This is the repository for the code used in the paper "On the Semantic Overlap of Operators in Stream Processing Engines".

**SETUP**

For information about the input data, please check the paper ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00793)). For convienence, the actual files used for the experiments can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAmvWTLMAFkwJapby6lXmc3equSXu0yt/view?usp=share_link).

To run experiments, you only need to download and run mvn clean package in the java folder

You can then run the experiments by executing one of the following scripts:

./scripts/flatmapwikipediasearch.sh  
./scripts/flatmapwikipedialinear.sh  
./scripts/flatmappalletssearch.sh  
./scripts/flatmappalletslinear.sh  
./scripts/joinwikipediasearch.sh  
./scripts/joinwikipedialinear.sh  
./scripts/joinpalletssearch.sh  
./scripts/joinpalletslinear.sh  

The scripts are named so that:
- if the name contains join, then the experiment is about the J operator; if the name contains flatmap, then the experiment is about the FM operator.
- if the name contains wikipedia, then the experiment is from the Wikipedia use case (used in the paper for the high-end server); if the name contains pallets, then the experiment is from the 2D Scans use case (used in the paper for the Odroid device).
- if the name contains linear, then each experiment starts with the given injection rate and grows by the given step up to the desired max injection rate; if the name contains search, then each experiment starts with the given injection rate (which should be one that cannot be sustained) and reduces/increases by half (of the previous rate) the rate of the new experiment, until the change is below a given threshold.

*NOTICE:* The thresholds in this repository are based on the hardware used to run the experiments described in the paper. If different hardware is used, the values should be adjusted accordingly

**PRODUCING GRAPHS**

Finally, to reproduce the graphs presented in the paper, please use the Jupyter Notebook from the jupyter folder. The notebook contains comments to help producing the graphs.
